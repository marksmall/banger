This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build NodeJS based apps.

## Purpose

The basic tenet of this project is to provide a life-cycle base build system
to automate NodeJS application(s). The life-cycle provide points we can
attach tasks to. This provides the ability to provide an extensible base of
tasks to build any application.

## Life-cycle

There are in fact multiple life-cycles, **Clean** and **Default**.

| Name       | Description                                                   |
| ---------- |:------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pre-clean  | execute processes needed prior to the actual project cleaning |
| clean      | remove all files generated by the previous build              |
| post-clean | execute processes needed to finalize the project cleaning     |

## Default Lifecycle

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| validate                | validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.                                                                                                   |
| initialize              | initialize build state, e.g. set properties or create directories.                                                                                                            |
| resources               | generate resources for inclusion in the package.                                                                                                                              |
| compile                 | compile the source code of the project.                                                                                                                                       |
| test-compile            | compile the test source code into the test destination directory                                                                                                              |
| test                    | run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.                                                           |
| package                 | take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.                                                                                             |
| deploy                  | done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.                              |
